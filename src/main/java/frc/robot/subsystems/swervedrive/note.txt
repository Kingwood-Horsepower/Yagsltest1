i kinda have maybe an idea of this shit going on here? idk, i copied most of it
it looks like there is a light of reading to be done of the swervelib.SwerveDrive class
in fact reading the whole class is needed idk
it just looked like i needed a bunch of getter functions for the weird commands to work (see my note there)
i basically copied all of it what am i saying
we need a lot of reading to do (elia that may just become soley you have a lot of reading to do)
unless this just works tho, then we can worry about autos and fuckall later
and if so we need to instead put our brain power into programming arms:
    gains + pid + trapezoid
    there is also motionmagic or magicmotion class that might make it easier
do that first so that we have a controllable robot before looking into advanced swerve programming

2 hours of bascially copying i stg this better just work
it compiled so why shouldnt it?
im tired and i need to convince mr eric that we cannot just "get away with mechanical without any cad/theoretical design"
    my source, litterally every fucking year before that we have designed a robot
    2025 BEST was shit
    2024 FRC was shit, that thang was built for a swerve train not a tank drive so the geometry didnt work out
        the ramp was way to steep for any amount of auton to be reliable beyond maybe a 2 note
    and i can garuntee you luis would say 2023 and 2022 was shit (they looked awful ima be real)

programming robots is not hard, elia is cracked, chatgpt is cracked, and so are the 50 people on discord that i will force elia to get help from
who am i ranting to
god im going to crash out
let me do cad please i stg please

fuck you eric
and fuck the stupid fucking school network
